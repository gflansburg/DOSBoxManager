# DOSBoxManager
A simple frontend for DOSBox.

I needed a nice frontend like the Android app, DOSBox Manager.  So I created this.  Like the Android version it has a GUI for editing the individual config file.
App has the ability to load with Windows and minimize to the system tray.  In addition, the app can remove the DOS files when removing a program.
